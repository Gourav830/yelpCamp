<h1>Yelp - Camp</h1>  
<p>This is my project built while understanding the database(mongo) and javascript library(express) using the node environment </p>
<h1>give it a try - https://cyan-joyous-cocoon.cyclic.app/campgrounds</h1>

This project uses mongo Database,Joi for schema verification
As we all know verification is a lot important . 
If no verification is done then there would be database error commming up.


this project is not based on react.
